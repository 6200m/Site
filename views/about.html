				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>
				It all started when Nintendo shut down WiiConnect24 on June 28, 2013. Some people were sad about it shutting down and missed it, others weren't.
				Someone that was feeling sad was named AwesomeMarioFan, and he decided to make a thread on a popular gaming forum named GBATemp about reverse engineering it on July 6, 2013.
				On March 5, 2014, he made another thread about what he was able to do (which only was getting the News Channel to work).
				Eventually on August 6, 2015, people starting posting on the thread talking about bringing WiiConnect24 back and started planning out the project.
				Since GBATemp wasn't the ideal place to plan this out, three people which are now developers of RiiConnect24 today (PokeAcer, Larsenv, and AwesomeMarioFan) made a Skype chat to talk about the project.
				Within a few days we had a server up and running.
				Someone named NeoRame made a logo for us and came up with the name RiiConnect24.
				RiiConnect24 turned out to be a great name for our project because has the same pronunciation as "reconnect", and the goal of the project is to reconnect Wiis to RiiConnect24.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				After some slow progress, we released the RiiConnect24 News Channel with the latest news on June 28, 2016, 3 years after the shutdown.
				Over time, we rolled out more features such as having pictures and the location where the articles take place.
				We also added support for other languages and have the latest headlines shown on the Wii Menu later.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				On December 3, 2016 we released Wii Mail, so now people can send messages over other Wiis.
				It also allows you to share data between games.
				16 days later, we released the RiiConnect24 Forecast Channel with the latest forecast.
				The project became open source on April 22, 2017.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Today, RiiConnect24 focuses on bringing more Wii Channels back and making your Wii look cool again.
				If you set up Wiimmfi as well, you can play games online again that used Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, so we recommend you use it.
				We are a small team of developers who are very young (the age range is actually 14 to 18) that are dedicated to working on this project.
